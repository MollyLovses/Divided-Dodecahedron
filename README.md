# 3D Geometry Processing with Three.js

## Overview

This project is aimed at processing 3D geometries, specifically faces of a dodecahedron, using the Three.js library. The code provides functionalities for subdividing faces, placing coordinates on a sphere, parsing JSON data, converting JavaScript objects to JSON strings, calculating areas of faces, performing vector calculations, creating and rotating faces, adding text labels to points, and animating the scene.

## Features

### Subdividing Faces

The code includes functions to divide the faces of a dodecahedron into smaller subdivisions. This process involves iteratively dividing each face into multiple smaller faces, resulting in a finer mesh representation.

### Placing Coordinates on a Sphere

Coordinates are placed on a sphere by calculating their intersection points with a sphere of a given radius. This allows for visualizing the vertices of the dodecahedron on a spherical surface.

### JSON Data Parsing

The project includes functions for fetching JSON data from a specified path and parsing it for further processing. This functionality enables the incorporation of external data sources into the 3D visualization.

### Vector Calculations

Various vector calculations are performed, including finding the center of a line or plane, moving vectors away from or closer to a given point, and calculating normal vectors of faces. These calculations are essential for positioning and manipulating geometric elements in 3D space.

### Face Creation and Rotation

Functions are provided for creating faces from sets of vertices and rotating faces around their centroids. This allows for dynamically modifying the geometry of the dodecahedron and visualizing the changes in real-time.

### Text Labeling

Text labels can be added to points in the 3D scene to provide additional information or context. This feature enhances the interpretability of the visualization by labeling specific points of interest.
